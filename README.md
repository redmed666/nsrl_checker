# NSRL-Checker

## Build

There is a Makefile for building the `nsrl_checker` tool. You need to have the environment variables `GOOS` and `GOARCH` set.
If you don't, the output file will be in /bin/unkos/unkarch folder.

```
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 make build
```

This command will output `nsrl_checker` in bin/darwin/amd64.# nsrl_checker
# nsrl_checker
